## Code of Conduct

This project follows a simple code of conduct:
- Be respectful and constructive in all interactions
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show empathy towards other community members
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully

## Getting Started

### Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

- **Bug Reports**: Help us identify and fix issues
- **Feature Requests**: Suggest new functionality
- **Code Contributions**: Implement new features or fix bugs
- **Documentation**: Improve or add documentation
- **Testing**: Test on different hardware configurations
- **Hardware Support**: Add support for new audio devices

### Good First Issues

Look for issues tagged with `good first issue` or `help wanted` if you're new to the project.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Rust**: Install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

2. **Linux Development Libraries** (Linux only):
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev pkg-config
   
   # Fedora/RHEL
   sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel pkgconfig
   
   # Arch Linux
   sudo pacman -S alsa-lib pkgconf
   ```

3. **Audio Hardware**: Various audio devices for testing (optional but helpful)

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Fork and Clone**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/audio-interrogator.git
   cd audio-interrogator
   ```

2. **Build and Test**:
   ```bash
   # Build the project
   cargo build
   
   # Run tests
   cargo test
   
   # Run the tool
   cargo run -- --help
   ```

3. **Development Build**:
   ```bash
   # For faster iteration during development
   cargo build
   
   # For production testing
   cargo build --release
   ```

## Making Contributions

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** to see if your bug/feature is already reported
2. **Open an issue** to discuss large changes before implementing
3. **Search existing PRs** to avoid duplicate work

### Branching Strategy

- `main` branch contains stable releases
- Create feature branches from `main`
- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/device-latency-measurement`, `fix/alsa-crash-on-disconnect`

## Coding Guidelines

### Rust Style

- Follow standard Rust formatting: `cargo fmt`
- Use `cargo clippy` for linting
- Write idiomatic Rust code
- Document public APIs with doc comments

### Code Organization

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.rs              # CLI interface and main application logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ devices/             # Device detection and management
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mod.rs          # Module exports
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types.rs        # Data structures
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cpal_devices.rs # CPAL backend
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ alsa_devices.rs # ALSA backend
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/              # Utility functions (future)
```

### Error Handling

- Use `anyhow::Result` for error propagation
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Don't panic in production code paths

### Audio Device Support

When adding support for new audio devices:

1. **Test on Real Hardware**: Ensure changes work with actual devices
2. **Handle Edge Cases**: Devices may behave unexpectedly
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Don't break existing functionality
4. **Documentation**: Update device compatibility lists

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Test with Multiple Devices**:
   ```bash
   # Test basic functionality
   cargo run
   
   # Test filtering
   cargo run -- --card 0
   cargo run -- --device USB
   
   # Test output formats
   cargo run -- --json
   cargo run -- --verbose
   ```

2. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Disconnecting devices while running
   - Systems with no audio devices
   - Systems with many audio devices
   - Devices in use by other applications

### Hardware Testing

If you have access to professional audio equipment, test with:
- USB audio interfaces (Focusrite, PreSonus, MOTU, etc.)
- Multiple card setups
- HDMI audio devices
- Bluetooth audio devices
- Various sample rates and bit depths

### Cross-Platform Testing

While primarily focused on Linux, test on:
- Different Linux distributions
- Various kernel versions
- Different desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, etc.)
- Both PulseAudio and JACK setups

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Document all public functions and structs
- Include examples in doc comments
- Explain complex algorithms or audio concepts

### User Documentation

- Update README.md for new features
- Add examples to USAGE.md
- Update OUTPUT_GUIDE.md for new output formats
- Keep CHANGELOG.md updated

### Documentation Format

```rust
/// Interrogates audio devices using the CPAL backend
/// 
/// This function enumerates all available audio devices through CPAL
/// and returns detailed information about their capabilities.
/// 
/// # Examples
/// 
/// ```rust
/// let devices = get_cpal_devices()?;
/// for device in devices {
///     println!("Device: {}", device.name);
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// # Errors
/// 
/// Returns an error if the audio subsystem is not available or
/// if there are permission issues accessing audio devices.
pub fn get_cpal_devices() -> Result<Vec<AudioDeviceInfo>> {
    // Implementation...
}
```

4. **Merge**: Once approved, changes will be merged

## Development Tips

### Debugging Audio Issues

1. **Use Verbose Logging**:
   ```bash
   RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -- --verbose
   ```

2. **Check ALSA State**:
   ```bash
   cat /proc/asound/cards
   aplay -l
   arecord -l
   ```

3. **Monitor Device Changes**:
   ```bash
   # Watch for device changes
   udevadm monitor --subsystem-match=sound
   ```

### Common Pitfalls

- **Permissions**: Audio device access requires proper permissions
- **Device States**: Devices may be in use by other applications
- **USB Timing**: USB devices may take time to enumerate
- **Driver Differences**: Different devices may expose capabilities differently

### Getting Help

- **GitHub Issues**: Ask questions in issues
- **Code Comments**: Leave detailed comments in complex code
- **Documentation**: Reference existing documentation and examples
